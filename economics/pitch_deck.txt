### **ASTEROID BELT INDUSTRIAL CORRIDOR**

#### *Energy-Based Mass Transport for a Spacefaring Civilization*

**Tagline:**
**Don’t lift mass from Earth. Move it through space the way nature already moves worlds.**

---

# **SLIDE 2 — The Problem**

### **Space industry cannot scale because of one bottleneck:**

## **Mass is too expensive to get off Earth.**

Today:

* $2,000/kg average to orbit
* Launch availability is limited
* Deep-space logistics are nonexistent
* Resource location is constrained by Earth’s geology
* Environmental costs make mining politically fragile

**Result:**
No large-scale orbital industry. No asteroid mining. No sustainable exploration.

# **SLIDE 3 — The Opportunity**

### The asteroid belt holds **trillions of tons** of high-value material:

* Platinum group metals
* Cobalt, nickel, rare earths
* Water (fuel), silicates (construction)
* Carbonaceous feedstocks
* Radiation shielding mass

### The solution isn’t rockets.

### The solution is **freight rails in space.**

# **SLIDE 4 — The Solution: ABIC**

### **A containerized, energy-based mass transport system:**

✅ **Electromagnetic mass drivers** fire modular cans
✅ **Magnetic harpoon tenders** swing between asteroids
✅ **Rotovator catchers** receive cans in cis-lunar space
✅ **Belt Ark** processes raw materials in situ
✅ **Anchor-Buoy Network** guides tenders and stabilizes orbits
✅ **Cans** travel on scheduled velocity lanes (Bulk → Emergency)

**No rockets. No propellant. Just energy + momentum exchange.**

# **SLIDE 5 — Technology Stack (All TRL 6–9)**

### **Already proven tech, recombined:**

✔ Electromagnetic launchers (railguns, gauss systems)
✔ Electrodynamic tethers
✔ Orbital construction (ISS heritage)
✔ Robotic mining (Earth + lunar demos)
✔ Solar/nuclear MW-class power
✔ Autonomous navigation + docking
✔ Cryo storage + life support from existing missions

**No physics breakthroughs required.**

# **SLIDE 6 — Business Model**

### **Revenue Streams**

* Sale of metals, volatiles, and industrial feedstocks
* Orbital construction supply (shielding, propellant, alloys)
* Freight transport (Bulk, Priority, Express, Emergency lanes)
* Depot power-as-a-service
* Licensing of CanCorridor standards
* Anchor-Buoy Network maintenance contracts

### **Projected Revenue:**

* Phase 1 output: ~$50–150M/year
* Phase 2: ~$500M–$2B/year
* Phase 3: $5–10B/year
* Long-term: **trillion-dollar orbital supply ecosystem**

# **SLIDE 7 — Economics at Scale**

### **Cost Per Kilogram to Orbit**

* Falcon Heavy: ~$1500–$2000
* Starship (future): ~$200–$500
* **ABIC Bulk Lane: $10–$50**

### **Energy Costs**

* Bulk: ~25–30 MWh per ton (launch + catcher)
* Priority/Express: more expensive but supports critical timelines

### **Throughput**

* 10 MW depot → 8–10 tons/day (Bulk)
* 30–50 MW → 25–50 t/day
* 200 MW → heavy industry scale

**More power = more throughput. The system scales cleanly.**

# **SLIDE 8 — Roadmap**

### **Phase 1 (0–5 years)**

* Orbital yard upgrade
* Cis-lunar depot (10–20 MW)
* First rotovator catcher
* First EM harpoon tender
* Initial Belt Ark modules
* Mass driver prototype
* Regulatory groundwork

### **Phase 2 (5–10 years)**

* Full Belt Ark
* Anchor-Buoy Network
* Two mass drivers
* Stable freight lanes active
* 30–50 MW depot power
* Commercial shipments begin

### **Phase 3 (10–20 years)**

* Express lanes operational
* 100–200 MW depot
* Multi-ark industrial cluster
* Global adoption
* Trillion-dollar orbital economy

# **SLIDE 9 — Competition & Moat**

### **Competitors**

* Terrestrial miners
* Lunar resource programs
* Traditional rocket-based cargo systems
* Nationalized space industries

### **ABIC Moat**

* Lowest cost per kg in history
* Containerized standardization
* No propellant → no scaling limits
* Safe, passive, automated freight
* International governance reduces conflict
* Massive first-mover advantage

# **SLIDE 10 — The Ask**

### To unlock Phase 1, we require:

✅ $5B–$7B seed capital
✅ International regulatory alignment
✅ Launch contracts for Ark modules
✅ Partnership with one nuclear provider
✅ Lunar Gateway docking rights
✅ Private sector consortium participation

### ABIC will:

* Reduce orbit logistics cost by >95%
* Kickstart the Belt economy
* Enable megastructure-scale construction
* Fundamentally reshape human civilization

**The industrialization of space begins here.**
