# 🌐 ABIC — Asteroid Belt Industrial Corridor (Open Standard)

### *A Public-Domain Framework for Interplanetary Logistics, Governance & Transparency*

The **Asteroid Belt Industrial Corridor (ABIC)** is a non-proprietary, public-domain standard for building safe, scalable, energy-based logistics infrastructure in near-space.
It unifies:

* **Engineering architecture** (mass drivers, tethers, depots, nodes)
* **Governance & treaty structure** (93-article convention + ratifiable ABIC-Lite)
* **Transparency & audit systems** (beneficial ownership, telemetry integrity, open data)
* **Economic & operational modeling**
* **Open collaboration principles**

ABIC is offered freely to the world, with **no rights reserved**, as a civic contribution toward cooperative interplanetary development.

This repository contains the complete, canonical version of the ABIC standard.

# 📂 Repository Structure

## **1. Core Standard**

These are the primary ABIC documents.

### **📜 Manifesto**

`manifesto/ABIC-Manifesto.md`
Foundational vision, civic philosophy, and high-level engineering rationale.

### **📘 Glossary**

`glossary/ABIC-Glossary.md`
A comprehensive reference of terminology, institutions, and technical concepts.

### **🤝 Contributing Guide**

`contributing/Contributing.md`
How to critique, propose changes, or extend the open standard.

### **📚 Unified Document**

`docs/ABIC-Unified-Document.md`
A consolidated single-file version for convenient reading and long-form distribution.

---

## **2. Treaty Layer — Governance Architecture**

### **📘 93-Article ABIC Framework Convention (Official Edition)**

`treaty/ABIC-Convention-93-Article.txt`
The full international governance specification: safety, sovereignty limitations, environmental protections, node authorities, mass-driver/tether standards, arbitration, transparency requirements, and system-wide interoperability.

### **📘 ABIC-Lite (Ratifiable Updated Edition)**

`treaty/ABIC-Lite-Updated.txt`
A compact 22-article version designed for early-stage adoption, policy pilots, and rapid legislative testing.

Both editions are **authoritative**, with ABIC-Lite serving as a minimal baseline and the 93-article version serving as the complete, long-form convention.

---

## **3. Economics & Logistics Modeling**

Located in:
`economics/`

This folder contains the quantitative backbone of ABIC:

* **pitch_deck.txt** — high-level overview for industry/policy stakeholders
* **business_plan.txt** — capex/opex structures, phasing, market dynamics
* **logistics.txt** — throughput scaling, MW↔ton ratios, energy budgets
* **founder_script.txt** — narrative explanation of system behavior
* **q_and_a.txt** — technical FAQ for engineering and economic inquiries
* **Economic-Reference.md** — unified master document
* **Pitch_Deck.pdf** — publication-ready slide deck export

These materials demonstrate that ABIC’s engineering and economics are **grounded, feasible, and consistent with near-term technology**.

---

## **4. Meta — Process Transparency**

Located in:
`meta/`

Includes:

* **on_process_and_possibility.txt** — reflections on human–AI collaboration
* **02_PROOF_OF_WORK.txt** — creation timestamp
* **03_ONE_CLICK_VERIFY.html** — automatic verification page

These documents preserve a transparent creation record and demonstrate that the standard was developed openly and in good faith.

---

## **5. AI Collaboration Logs**

Located in:
`logs/ai/`

Complete conversation logs from:

* ChatGPT
* Claude
* Gemini
* Grok
* Copilot

These are provided for **auditability, research, and historical context**.
They do *not* define the standard, but document how it was created.

---

## **6. Archive (Historical Drafts & Development Notes)**

Located in:
`archive/`

Contains raw drafts, unused versions, early prototypes, partial documents, and exploratory notes.
These are retained for version history and future research, but are not part of the live ABIC standard.

# 🧭 Purpose & Philosophy

ABIC exists to propose a **transparent, open, non-monopolistic** logistics architecture for near-space:

* Energy-based transport instead of propellant-heavy rockets
* Momentum-exchange tethers and mass drivers as freight corridors
* Standardized containers (ISCs) for orbital supply chains
* Node-based governance with strict transparency and auditability
* No sovereign claims, no proprietary choke points
* A fully inspectable system designed to serve humanity, not special interests

ABIC is structured intentionally like:

* a **W3C-style engineering standard**,
* a **UN-style governance framework**, and
* a **NASA-style logistics architecture**—
  all integrated as one open system.

# 🚀 Build What Comes Next

ABIC is a blueprint for cooperative expansion beyond Earth.
It demonstrates what becomes possible when human judgment and AI capability work together transparently, deliberately, and in service of the public good.

If we build ABIC,
**we inherit the sky.**
