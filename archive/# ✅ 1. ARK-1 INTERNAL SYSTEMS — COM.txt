# ✅ **1. ARK-1 INTERNAL SYSTEMS — COMPLETE SYSTEMS MODEL**

### ✅ **1.1 Life Support (LS) – Redundant, Segmentable, Fault-Tree Driven**

Ark-1 uses a **four-loop architecture**:

#### **Loop A — Air Handling (Primary)**

* Forced air circulation
* CO₂ scrubbing: **solid amine beds** (regenerative)
* Emergency: LiOH cartridges
* Redundancy: 2× independent fans per sector

**Failure Modes:**

* Fan failure → localized CO₂ pocket
* Amine bed saturation → systemic CO₂ rise
* Fire → toxic byproducts

**Mitigations:**

* Sectorized valves
* Air-path isolation
* CO₂ alarms in every compartment
* “Brownout Mode” reduces metabolic load by lowering activity levels

---

#### **Loop B — Water & Humidity (Primary Water Loop)**

* Greywater recycling → ultrafiltration → UV → remineralization
* Condensate recovery from air
* Blackwater digester feeding BSFL
* Storage: 90,000 L in shield-ring tanks

**Failure Modes:**

* Pipe breach (high-risk in rotating frame)
* Pump seizure
* Microbial bloom in bioreactor
* Hydrolysis reactor offline

**Mitigations:**

* Automated sector shutdowns
* Cross-feed between tanks
* Secondary feedwater line
* “Water Discipline Mode” (⅓ ration for 48 hours)

---

#### **Loop C — Biological Loop (Agriculture)**

* BSFL → plant nutrient loop
* Algae tubes for O₂ buffer
* 3 m fish reservoir for protein

**Failure Modes:**

* Blight in hydroponics
* Pythium in root beds
* Ammonia spike from fish
* Loss of BSFL colony

**Mitigations:**

* Cryo-vault seedstock

* UV flood mode
* Chemical shock treatment
* 180-day emergency food reserves
* 30-day O₂ reserve

---

#### **Loop D — Thermal Control**

* Heat exchangers → radiator ribbons
* Rotational differential compensation
* Emergency ammonia dump line (last resort)

**Failure Modes:**

* Coolant pump failure
* Radiator puncture (debris)
* Stagnant hot loop
* Reactor thermal runaway (in rare SCRAM edge cases)

**Mitigations:**

* Shut down heat-intensive systems
* Isolate loop sections
* Switch to reduced-power reactor mode
* Radiator ribbon retraction into armored sleeve

# ✅ **4. GOVERNANCE ABOARD THE ARK — WHO DECIDES WHAT?**

Ark-1 governance must satisfy:

* ABIC treaty obligations
* SRA nuclear authority chain
* Crew autonomy
* Emergency command structure
* Democratic legitimacy

Here is the blended model:

---

## ✅ **4.1 “Tripod Model” — Democratic + Technocratic + Treaty-Bound**

### **Leg 1 — Democratic Crew Council**

* 20 elected representatives (4-month terms)
* Controls:

  * recreation policies
  * work schedules
  * agricultural priorities
  * crew living conditions
* Can override Command Deck on **non-safety** matters

---

### **Leg 2 — Technocratic Command Deck**

Handles **anything involving safety or physics**, including:

* NPU operations
* Reactor SCRAM decisions
* Navigation
* Catcher operations
* EVA go/no-go
* Fire-Spine alignment
* Water-farm pressure management

Command Deck decisions can only be overridden by the SRA.

---

### **Leg 3 — Treaty-Bound SRA Authority**

The SRA has absolute authority in:

* Reactor safety
* Radiological exposure
* SCRAM actuation
* Annex A compliance
* Fire-spine certification during Water Blitz
* Telemetry integrity

The SRA cannot override:

* crew living conditions
* democratic decisions
* deployment schedules **unless** safety is implicated

# ✅ **5. EMERGENCY COMMAND OVERRIDE (EC-0 Protocol)**

When lives are directly at risk:

### **EC-0 Hierarchy**

1. **Safety Officer (SRA liaison)**
2. **Reactor Chief (if nuclear-related)**
3. **Captain**
4. **Deputy Captain**

Crew Council is suspended during EC-0.
