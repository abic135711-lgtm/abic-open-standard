# ✅ **Founder’s Spoken Script — ASTEROID BELT INDUSTRIAL CORRIDOR**

# **SLIDE 1 — Title**

**“Thank you all for being here.
I’m [Founder Name], and today I’m going to show you something extraordinary, but absolutely achievable.**

**The Asteroid Belt Industrial Corridor isn’t science fiction.
It’s a logistics system.
A freight network.
A new kind of infrastructure — and the first step toward a true space economy.”**

---

# **SLIDE 2 — The Problem**

**“Right now, space industry is stuck in a paradox.
We want to build and manufacture in space, but the raw materials we need… are all trapped at the bottom of Earth’s gravity well.

Rockets are incredible machines.
But they are fundamentally bad trucks.
Expensive, inefficient, and physically incapable of scaling to match industry-level demand.

This is the bottleneck that has prevented us from industrializing space for 60 years.

It’s not a technology problem.
It’s a mass transport problem.”**

# **SLIDE 3 — The Opportunity**

**“Meanwhile, the asteroid belt is overflowing with resources.
Raw materials we fight wars over on Earth exist in quantities that stagger the imagination.

A single metallic asteroid contains more platinum than humanity has mined in all of history.
Water reserves large enough to fuel a thousand missions.
Iron, nickel, cobalt, silicates — everything we need to build almost anything.

The problem isn’t supply.
The problem is *moving materials efficiently*.

And we realized:
Nature already solved this.
Planets move mass without propellant.
Momentum exchange does the work.

We can copy that.”**

# **SLIDE 4 — The Solution: ABIC**

**“ABIC is a containerized transportation system that uses energy and physics instead of rockets.

We fire standardized cargo cans from electromagnetic launch rails.
Tenders use magnetic harpoons to swing between iron-rich asteroids without propellant.
Rotovator tethers in cis-lunar space catch incoming cans and drop them into storage depots.
And our Belt Ark — a rotating habitat and processing ship — prepares resources on-site.

It’s the world’s first freight railroad in space.

And every component is achievable with existing engineering.”**

---

# **SLIDE 5 — Technology Stack**

**“Nothing here depends on exotic physics.
It’s not fusion.
It’s not warp drives.

These are technologies with decades of testing behind them:
mass drivers, tethers, autonomous docking, robotic mining, orbital assembly, solar and nuclear power.

Our innovation is combining them into a single system — one that is modular, scalable, and economically self-sustaining.

This is logistics, not rocket science.
Literally.”**

---

# **SLIDE 6 — Business Model**

**“The business model is simple.

We sell raw materials.
We deliver freight to orbit.
We sell propellant, metals, water, construction feedstocks.
We sell power at depot.
We license container standards and mining technologies.

Our revenue streams aren’t just diverse — they reinforce one another.

The real value is that ABIC becomes the backbone infrastructure for all future space industry.”**

# **SLIDE 7 — Economics at Scale**

**“This is where the physics turns into dollars.

Today, getting mass to orbit costs between $500 and $2000 per kilogram.
Using ABIC, our effective cost for bulk freight is under $50 per kilogram.

At scale, under $10.

Not someday.
Not in 50 years.
With today’s technology, if deployed intelligently.

And because capacity scales with power instead of propellant, we can increase throughput simply by adding more megawatts at the depot.

This is the first transportation system in human history where cost goes *down* as volume goes *up*.”**

# **SLIDE 8 — Roadmap**

**“Here is how we actually build it.

Phase 1: We upgrade an orbital shipyard, deploy our first catcher tether, test mass drivers, and assemble the initial Belt Ark modules.
Five years.

Phase 2: We complete the Ark, deploy anchor buoys, bring the first asteroid cluster under operations, and begin commercial deliveries.
Ten years.

Phase 3: We scale power, add express freight lanes, build multiple Arks, and establish a fully industrialized belt economy.
Twenty years.

This isn’t a moonshot.
This is a construction schedule.”**

---

# **SLIDE 9 — Competition & Moat**

**“Who are our competitors?

Terrestrial mining companies.
Lunar resource programs.
Traditional launch providers.

Our advantage is that we operate in a regime where none of them can follow.

No gravity well.
No propellant dependency.
No launch bottleneck.

Our moat is physics.
And it is enormous.

Once the first Ark and catcher system are operational, we become the default freight network of the inner solar system.”**

---

# **SLIDE 10 — The Ask**

**“Here is what we need to start Phase 1.

Five to seven billion dollars.
That’s it — roughly half the cost of a modern aircraft carrier.

International regulatory alignment for nuclear power in space.
Three launch contracts.
And one nuclear provider partnership.

In exchange, you are buying the foundational infrastructure for humanity’s next century.

The industrialization of space.
The end of scarcity in orbit.
And the creation of a trillion-dollar market.

This is not a dream.
This is a blueprint.

And with your support, we can begin building it today.”**
