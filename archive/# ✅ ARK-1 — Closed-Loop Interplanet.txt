# **3. Waste → Food Loop (Reality-Checked)**

### Liquid side

✅ **Urine → Forward Osmosis membranes → 98% potable water**
✅ Minerals to soil farms

### Solid side

✅ Feces + food scraps → 70°C anaerobic digester
Produces:

* CH₄ → solid oxide fuel cells → electricity + heat + CO₂
* Digestate → soil agriculture

### Carbon loop

CO₂ → Algae (spirulina + chlorella) photobioreactors
Algae →

* Protein supplement
* Feedstock for **black soldier fly larvae (BSFL)**

BSFL →

* Poultry feed
* Fish feed
* Compost enrichment

Compost → soil → crops → humans → waste → digester.

### Loop closure metrics (corrected)

* **CO₂ load:** 500 ppl → ~700–750 kg/day
* **Algae area needed:** ~1000–1500 m²
* **Digester volume:** ~150–180 m³
* **Urine processor:** ~3 m³/day module
* **System closure:** ~**99% achievable**, not 100%

# **6. Mass Budget (Corrected)**

### Launch Mass (dry)

| Category                | Mass                               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Structure + hull        | 18,000–25,000 t                    |
| Closed-loop bio-systems | 2,000 t                            |
| Air (N₂/O₂)             | **500 t**                          |

This is the only realistic solution.

### Launch cadence

Dry mass:

* **~60–80 Starship flights** at 150 t to LEO
  vs
* ~400+ flights if launching shield water

# Thermal budget & radiator sizing

## Major steady heat sources (rule-of-thumb, 500 crew)

* **LED farms (photosynthetic lighting):** 1.5–2.5 MWₑ input
  Practically **~100% ends as heat** (either in fixtures or after photons are absorbed).
* **SOFC power from digester methane:** 0.6–1.0 MWₑ at ~60% elec. efficiency → **0.4–0.7 MW** heat (stack + balance of plant).
* **Crew metabolic heat:** ~100 W/person avg → **~50 kW**.
* **Environmental systems & electronics (fans, pumps, controls, computing):** **0.2–0.5 MW** (most ends as heat).
* **Lighting & habitat losses (non-farm):** **0.1–0.3 MW**.

**Design waste-heat total (continuous):**
**Low:** 2.3–2.8 MW **Likely:** 3.0–3.8 MW **High:** 4.0–5.0 MW (with margin / growth)

> Operational note: nearly **all electrical input** becomes heat eventually; treat electric power ≈ thermal load.

## Radiator sizing (gray-body, space view factor ≈1)

Use ( P = \varepsilon\sigma A T^4 \Rightarrow A = \dfrac{P}{\varepsilon\sigma T^4} )

* ( \sigma = 5.670\times10^{-8}\ \mathrm{W,m^{-2},K^{-4}} ), emissivity ( \varepsilon \approx 0.9 ) (second-surface Ag/Kapton or SiO(_2)-Alumina paints).

Reference areas **per 1 MW** rejected:

* **350 K (77 °C):** (T^4 \approx 1.5\times10^{10}) → **~1,300 m²/MW**
* **400 K (127 °C):** (T^4 = 2.56\times10^{10}) → **~770 m²/MW**
* **450 K (177 °C):** (T^4 = 4.10\times10^{10}) → **~480 m²/MW**

**Recommended radiator plan (belt environment, low solar flux):**

* Size for **4 MW @ 400 K → ~3,100 m²**, with **N+1 segmentation** (e.g., six wings × ~600 m²).
* Working fluid: **ammonia** or **propane** loop heat pipes to pumped two-phase manifolds.
* Include **hot-side thermal buses** near farms/SOFCs and **deployable panels** shadowed from habitat windows.

---

# Power architecture (MW-class, redundant)

## Source mix

* **Primary:** **Nuclear fission**, **8 MWₑ** installed (e.g., **4 × 2 MWₑ** modules), **N+2** for 3–5 MW continuous critical load.

  * Reactor class: space-tolerant fast-spectrum or HEU/HALU derivative; Brayton or Rankine conversion.
  * Each module with independent shadow shields and quick-disconnect heat rejection.
* **Secondary:** **Solar-nuclear hybrid** (optional). At ~2.7–3.2 AU, solar flux is ~**1/8–1/10 of LEO**.

  * 1 MWₑ solar demands **~30–50k m²** high-efficiency arrays → feasible for **aux/peaking**, not baseload.
* **Tertiary:** **SOFC CHP** from digester methane (**0.6–1.0 MWₑ**) feeding the **hot water/thermal bus**; prioritize heat capture.

## Distribution & conversion

* **Primary bus:** **±1.5 kV to ±3 kV DC** ring bus, dual, cross-tied, with **solid-state breakers** and sectionalizers.
* **Secondary buses:** 600 V DC (farm blocks, pumps) and 120/230 V AC (habitat).
* **Load management:**

  * **Tier-1 (critical):** life support, pumps, avionics, comms → triple-fed, battery + flywheel ride-through.
  * **Tier-2 (high):** farms, thermal loops → sheddable in blocks, curtailment <10%.
  * **Tier-3 (non-critical):** workshops, rec spaces → deep shed on anomaly.
* **Storage:** **5–10 MWh** distributed LiFePO₄ or Na-ion + **flywheels** for second-scale transients and spin-energy trades (see below).
* **Protections:** differential + arc-fault on DC, EMI/EMC zoning, Faraday partitioning around reactors/converters.

# Habitat rotation dynamics

## Spin parameters (corrected geometry)

* **Radius (R) ≈ 118 m; ω = 2.3 rpm = 0.2409 rad/s** → **0.7 g** at rim.

## Angular momentum & spin-up energy

Approximate moment of inertia (ring-like mass near rim): ( I \approx \tfrac{1}{2} M R^2 )

* **Habitat dry mass** (M) ≈ **3.0×10^7 kg** (30,000 t representative)
* ( I \approx 0.5 \times 3.0\times10^7 \times (118)^2 \approx 2.1\times10^{11}\ \mathrm{kg,m^2} )
* Spin energy: ( E=\tfrac{1}{2}I\omega^2 \approx 0.5\times2.1\times10^{11}\times(0.2409)^2 \approx 6.0\times10^{9}\ \mathrm{J} ) (**~6 GJ**)

  * **At 2 MW net torque power** → **~50 min** to full spin (engineering margin: several hours).
  * If mass ×3 or torque limited, still **<1 workday** to nominal.

## How to spin (and stop) safely

* **Primary:** **Counter-rotating flywheel ring** (internal) trades momentum with habitat → **spin-up/despin with zero propellant**, fine control, and **no external torque**.
* **Secondary:** **RCS thrusters** on radius arms; use only for coarse momentum management or contingency.
* **Tertiary:** **Tethered tug** for very slow momentum bleed without plume impingement.

## Gyroscopic stability & control

* Align **reactor booms, radiators, and docking thrust lines through the spin axis** to avoid persistent torques.
* **Control-moment gyros (CMGs)** or large **reaction wheels** trim precession from docking, mining tenders, or misbalanced payloads.
* **Mass-balancing system:** move water/slag in circumferential tanks to re-zero the principal axis (automated every orbit/day).

## Emergency despin protocols

* **FAST:** dump flywheel momentum to heat (eddy current brakes) + RCS counter-impulse → **minutes** to partial despin.
* **SMOOTH:** trade momentum to tethered tug or ejectable ballast packs → **hours**; minimal structural shock.
* **HARD FAULT cases:** sectionalize structure; lock crew to inner rings; keep 0.3–0.5 g zones available during partial despin.

# Crew rotation model (500 people)

## Shift architecture

* **Three-shift, 8 h** cadence for 24/7 stability: **Alpha (00–08), Beta (08–16), Gamma (16–24)** habitat time.
* **Work blocks (per person/day):**

  * 6 h mission ops (role-dependent)
  * 1 h community/service (galley, sanitation, mentoring)
  * **2 h physical conditioning** (see below)
  * **8 h sleep**, **2 h meals**, **5 h personal/learning/family**
  * Flex windows for researchers/parents/medical.

## Exercise & gravity health

* **Daily minimum:** **2 h**

  * **0.5 h @ 1.0 g** in **centrifuge pods** (bone-loading; alternating days add 0.2–0.3 g increments)
  * **1.5 h** mixed cardio/resistance in 0.7 g (interval programs, harnessed treadmills, rowing, squats).
* **Compliance tracking:** wearables + medbay DEXA schedule quarterly; auto-adjust personal plan.

## Zone throughput & crowding

* **Farm blocks**: operated in **two shifts** (lighting duty cycles offset) to spread loads; each block has **Tier-1/2 power feeds** and **crew egress drills**.
* **Parks/forest/reef**: scheduled quiet hours per shift; acoustic zoning and light-temperature circadian cues.
* **Galley/dining**: 3 main cycles aligned to shifts + micro-galley kiosks to avoid rushes.
* **Education/rec**: clustered near mid-radius corridors to minimize commute across gravity gradient.

## Duty roster mix (typical steady-state)

* **Life support & thermal:** 40–60
* **Agriculture & bioprocess:** 120–150
* **Power & mechanical:** 60–80
* **Science/medical:** 40–60
* **Ops/comms/navigation:** 30–40
* **Manufacturing/fab/repairs:** 60–80
* **Education/childcare/culture:** 30–40
* **Governance/security/admin:** 20–30
  (Headcount flexes by phase; cross-training is mandatory.)
