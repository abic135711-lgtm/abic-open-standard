# 🧭 Governance & Ethics

### **Access Neutrality**

The principle that orbital infrastructure must be equally accessible to all signatory jurisdictions, regardless of economic, military, or political status. Enforced by **IFOC** through **Corridor Operating Certificates (COC)** and non-discriminatory scheduling.

### **Red-Flag Suspension**

A temporary halt of treaty privileges triggered by verified violations, pending review and remediation. Designed to prevent escalation while preserving accountability. Evaluated by the **Hazard Review & Red-Flag Board (HRRB)** with mandatory **Proportionality Review**.

*Example: If an operator fails to report a tether failure within 24 hours, a Red-Flag Suspension temporarily blocks their access to high-priority corridors until compliance is restored and safety protocols are verified.*

### **Transparency Trigger**

A threshold event—such as launch, docking, or resource extraction—that automatically initiates public disclosure protocols in machine-readable format through the **Civic Data Layer (CDL)**. Creates **Public Ledger Events (PLE)** that cannot be suppressed.

*Example: When a cargo container docks at a depot, its manifest, contractor information, and beneficial owners are automatically published to the public dashboard within 60 seconds.*

### **Beneficial Ownership**

The true individuals or entities who benefit from a contract, asset, or vendor relationship, regardless of formal registration or shell structures. Required disclosure prevents covert monopolistic control.

*Example: If Company A is registered in Delaware, owned by Company B in the Cayman Islands, which is owned by Person C, then Person C is the beneficial owner—even if only Company A's name appears on the contract. ABIC requires Person C's disclosure.*

### **Beneficial Ownership Threshold**

The percentage of effective control (typically 5–10%) at which an individual or entity must be publicly disclosed under ABIC transparency rules. Managed by the **Beneficial Ownership & Contract Integrity Office (BOCIO)**.

### **Public Stewardship**

The ethical obligation to manage infrastructure, data, and resources in service of the public good, not private gain. Core principle underlying all **Operator** responsibilities.

### **Civic Covenant**

The implicit agreement between citizens and institutions that power will be exercised transparently, equitably, and accountably. ABIC makes this covenant explicit and enforceable.

### **Proportionality Review**

A mandatory evaluation ensuring that enforcement actions are fair, non-punitive, and no more restrictive than necessary to restore safety. Conducted by **HRRB** before any **Red-Flag Suspension** becomes permanent.

### **Technical Witness Panel (TWP)**

A rotating, neutral panel of engineers and data specialists responsible for validating safety events, anomalies, and red-flag triggers. Reports to the **Independent Safety & Compliance Bureau (ISCB)**.

### **Vendor Integrity Registry**

A public database listing all contractors, subcontractors, and beneficial owners contributing to ABIC infrastructure. Maintained by **BOCIO** as part of the **Contract Ledger**.

### **Dispute-Escalation Track**

A tiered conflict-resolution pathway moving from data-first mediation → independent review → treaty arbitration. Final binding decisions issued by the **Treaty Arbitration Chamber (TAC)**.

### **Safety Event**

A verified incident posing immediate risk to life, infrastructure, or mission integrity. Triggers investigation by ISCB and may initiate a Red-Flag Suspension. See also: Anomaly, Remediation Plan, HRRB

### **Anomaly**

A deviation from expected telemetry, behavior, or environmental conditions requiring investigation and potential remediation. See also: Safety Event, TIC, TWP

### **Remediation Plan**

A corrective roadmap submitted by an Operator to restore compliance after a Safety Event or violation. Must be approved by ISCB and HRRB before lifting a Red-Flag Suspension. See also: Audit Trail, Proportionality Review

See also: Capture Window, Approach Vector Certification, Rotational Safety Envelope.

### **Approach Corridor**  

The designated path for incoming vessels or cargo pods approaching a **Capture Window**, specifying velocity and alignment tolerances. Violations trigger automatic alerts through **COCO**.

### **Rotational Safety Envelope**  

The clearance required around **Momentum-Exchange Tether** systems to prevent collision or capture anomalies. Defined by **ISCB** engineering standards and enforced through **COCO** traffic management.

### **Docking Harmonization Standard**  

Mechanical and algorithmic alignment protocols governing ABIC docking operations. Ensures all **ISCs** can dock at any certified **Orbital Node** regardless of manufacturer or nationality.

### **Approach Vector Certification**

A validation process ensuring incoming vessels meet velocity, timing, and alignment tolerances for safe docking or tether capture. Managed by **COCO** and required for entry into Approach Corridors and Capture Windows. See also: Rotational Safety Envelope, Docking Harmonization Standard


### **Telemetry**

The automated transmission and reception of data from remote infrastructure, used for monitoring, diagnostics, and compliance. Telemetry forms the backbone of ABIC’s transparency architecture and is subject to Telemetric Integrity Checks (TIC). See also: TIC, Anomaly, Audit Trail
