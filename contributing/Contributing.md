# 🤝 Contributing to ABIC

Thank you for your interest in shaping the future of orbital infrastructure.  
This repository is open to critique, expansion, and collaborative stewardship.

## 🧭 Ways to Contribute
- **Feedback**: Open an issue to challenge, refine, or expand any part of the treaty or annexes.
- **Pull Requests**: Propose edits to treaty language, technical standards, or outreach materials.
- **Expert Additions**: Help expand the curated list of validators, engineers, ethicists, and diplomats.
- **Public Amplification**: Share the treaty, host discussions, and invite scrutiny.

## 🧱 Contribution Guidelines
- **Be specific.** Reference article numbers, section titles, or line ranges when possible.
- **Be respectful.** This is a civic artifact and a public good; treat it accordingly.
- **Be well-reasoned.** Radical ideas are welcome — when supported by data, precedent, or engineering insight.
- **Be transparent.** Clearly state your assumptions, models, and sources.

## 🛡️ Security & Safety Disclosures
If you discover a safety flaw, systemic vulnerability, or escalation path within the treaty or technical designs,
